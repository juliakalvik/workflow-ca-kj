# React + Vite

[REPORT]

# WorkFlow

## Overview

This report focuses on adding new features to improve the project and testing those features.

## Team Members

- Khadar
- Julia

## Approach

We followed the guidelines for the CA and implemented the required elements.

## Features

- Forked a previous project and created a workflow branch.
- Configured ESLint, Prettier, and hooks.
- Used Vitest for unit testing.
- Added a mock token for when a user is logged in, which is removed when the logout button is pressed.
- Conducted E2E tests with Cypress: tested logging in and landing on the profile page, tested logging in with the wrong email and receiving an error message, and tested logging out.

## Conclusion

There was good communication within the group. We resolved all issues while working physically together at school, so the Issues tab in GitHub was not used. We installed the necessary packages and utilities and proceeded to test the functions, fixing bugs along the way. Overall, everything went well.
